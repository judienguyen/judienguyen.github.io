                        <h4>Game Description</h4>
                        <p>The player is in the perspective of the crab. In order to fight off the fish, <br>
                        the play will use arrow keys to attack. For every attack on a fish using the arrow keys, <br>
                        the play will earn a point. In order to win, the play must earn 100 points. <br>
                       If the fish reach the crab before the crab earns 100 points, the game ends.<br>
                       The randomness of the fish's color increases with the increasingly difficult levels.</p>
                       <h4>Reflection</h4>
                       <p>The inspiration behind the game was taken from the game, Fist of Fury. <br>
                       Two successful points from the game include the well-designed home page, and functioning increasing difficulties. <br>
                       In the beginning, we did not know how to have the background switch to end page once the fish reached a certain point. <br>
                       We made it a lot more difficult than it was meant to be, including coordinates and what not, <br>
                       until we realized we could just switch once the fish touched the crab. We reached another obstacle with the respawning fish. <br>
                       At first, we were having the fish hide and reappear. When that wasn't working, we figured a much simpler solution was to just have the fish go back to its original position. <br>
                       If we had more time, I would have added more music that functioned properly.

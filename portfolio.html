                        <h4>Game Description</h4>
                        <p>The player is in the perspective of the crab. In order to fight off the fish, <br>
                        the play will use arrow keys to attack. For every attack on a fish using the arrow keys, <br>
                        the play will earn a point. In order to win, the play must earn 100 points. <br>
                       If the fish reach the crab before the crab earns 100 points, the game ends.<br>
                       The randomness of the fish's color increases with the increasingly difficult levels.</p>
                       <h4>Reflection</h4>
                       <p>The inspiration behind the game was taken from the game, Fist of Fury. <br>
                       Two successful points from the game include the well-designed home page, and functioning increasing difficulties. <br>
                       In the beginning, we did not know how to have the background switch to end page once the fish reached a certain point. <br>
                       We made it a lot more difficult than it was meant to be, including coordinates and what not, <br>
                       until we realized we could just switch once the fish touched the crab. We reached another obstacle with the respawning fish. <br>
                       At first, we were having the fish hide and reappear. When that wasn't working, we figured a much simpler solution was to just have the fish go back to its original position. <br>
                       If we had more time, I would have added more music that functioned properly.
                       </p>

            <p>"What in the World is Going On?!" is an interactive choose your own adventure story, inspired by superhero stories. <br>
            It follows the tale of the user and his or her dog, Taro. In this story, the two earn separate superpowers and are forced to battle their enemy to survive.</p>

            <p>A) While creating the story, I first ran into difficulties in getting the code to run at all. After fixing the indentation issues, I ran into further problems with the incremental processes.
            I had to write each single event of the story and its follow-up outcomes to decisions as individual functions.
            When follow-up events would not function properly and I soon realized it was an issue with missing function lines, and excess, unnecessary events. An iterative process I included was the old_man() function.
            This function ran despite all previous decisions the user had made, summoning the story's villain.<br>
            <br>
            B) The story structure is a form of procedural abstraction, as the scenes are in the form of functions.
            Certain functions could be reused during the story, such as the old_man() function, that would run despite the previous decisions of the user.
            Abstraction made the story and the code easy to follow, as scenes were separated, as well as if-statements.
            The if-statements were placed in the scenes accordingly, rather than a full storyline. <br>
            <br>
            C) One story I enjoyed was the Ryan Trang Simulator, because it was based on true events and was an entertaining read.</p>
